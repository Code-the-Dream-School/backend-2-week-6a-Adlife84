# Backend2 Week 6 Lesson 6a

This repository is one of two for Week 6.  You will use this repository to create an application that implements a JSON REST API.  After you clone this repository,
you should make a git branch for lesson6a.  You should make the changes to this branch necessary to implement the API, and add on the changes necessary to
implement Swagger and to enable the API to be called from Ajax.  You should then do git operations to push the branch to github and create a pull request as usual.

The instructions for the changes and the link to the online tutorial are here: https://learn.codethedream.org/backend-2-json-rest-api-swagger-ajax/
